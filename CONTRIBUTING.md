# Contributing to Furry-octo-potato
(the name'll be changed)

## Firstly, thanks for taking the time to help us!^-^

And secondly, it's pretty hard to write the whole "contributing guidelines" file,   
so we'll just tell you the ways you can help us if you want to:

- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting Enhancements  
(you could also create pull requests, but the game doesn't has apropriate description yet, we are working on this)
